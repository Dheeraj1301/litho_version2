üî¨ Lithography in Semiconductor Manufacturing
Definition:
Lithography is a microfabrication process used to transfer patterns onto a substrate (usually a silicon wafer). It's a key step in building integrated circuits (ICs).

Purpose:
To pattern the surface of a wafer with micro/nanoscale features using light or other radiation.

üì∏ Photomasking (Photomask)
Definition:
A photomask is a glass or quartz plate with opaque patterns on it. It acts as a stencil that defines the desired micro-pattern to be transferred to the wafer.

Function:
Used during photolithography to block or allow light to hit specific areas of the photoresist-coated wafer.

üõ†Ô∏è Photolithography Process Overview
Wafer Cleaning: Remove contaminants to ensure adhesion.

Photoresist Application: A light-sensitive material is spin-coated on the wafer.

Soft Bake: Dries and hardens the photoresist.

Alignment and Exposure:

The wafer is aligned with the photomask.

UV light shines through the mask, exposing the photoresist.

Development: Removes the exposed (or unexposed) parts of the photoresist.

Etching: Transfers the pattern to the underlying material.

Resist Strip: Removes remaining photoresist.

üß™ Types of Lithography
Type	Radiation Used	Feature Size	Common Use
Photolithography	Ultraviolet (UV)	~7 nm (EUV)	IC fabrication
Electron-beam (E-beam)	Electron beam	<10 nm	Mask making, research
Extreme UV (EUV)	EUV (13.5 nm)	<7 nm	Advanced nodes (e.g., 5nm, 3nm)
X-ray Lithography	X-rays	<20 nm	Research

üß† Key Concepts
Resolution: Minimum feature size that can be reliably printed.

Depth of Focus (DOF): Range over which the image remains sharp.

Mask Alignment: Critical for overlay accuracy across multiple layers.

üß≠ Applications of Lithography
Microprocessor and memory chip manufacturing

MEMS devices (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems)

Photonic circuits

Display panels (OLED, LCD)

üß© Quick Terms to Know
Positive Photoresist: Exposed areas become soluble.

Negative Photoresist: Exposed areas remain insoluble.

Step-and-Repeat: Technique using a stepper to expose one die at a time.

Mask Blanks: Unpatterned plates used to fabricate photomasks.
